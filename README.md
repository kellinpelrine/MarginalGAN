# MarginalGAN
Research on improving GAN performance by separating classes. Work in progress. Many files not yet uploaded.

Author: Kellin Pelrine. I extensively use others' work, often with modification, including the following.

This method can substantially improve performance on MNIST and FMNIST, as measured by CAFD (with similar IS and FID).

There is more information included in the report on part 1 of the project and the proposal for part 2.
